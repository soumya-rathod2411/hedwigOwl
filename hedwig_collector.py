hedwig_collector.py

Now uses Tavily (an official search API built for AI agents) instead
of the free/unofficial DuckDuckGo scraper -- more accurate, structured
results, and no more surprise rate-limit blocks.

Budget: 10 categories x 1 query each, run 3x/day (every 8 hours) =
30 queries/day, ~900/month -- comfortably inside Tavily's free
1,000/month tier.

Requires:
